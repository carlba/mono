## How to Select Programming Paradigm

Use functional programming when you're transforming complete datasets without early termination. Use imperative loops when you need early exit, mutable lookup tables, or searching—where the algorithm's nature is about control flow, not data transformation.

## Big-0 Notion

[Structy Big-O Notation Basics](https://www.structy.net/problems/big-o-basics)

- Allows us to compare performance of algorithms
- Does not rely upon environment (language, hardware)

### Simplification Rules

- Drop any constant factors
- Drop any smaller terms in a sum

Write a function, pairs, that takes in an array as an argument. The function should return an array containing all unique pairs of elements.

You may return the pairs in any order and the order of elements within a single pair does not matter.

You can assume that the input array contains unique elements.

## Hashing

By using hashing we can reduce complexity from 0(n^2) to O(n)
